```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

Set seed for reproducibility.

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
```

### Z score function

Z scores substract the mean and divide by the sd.

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(20, mean = 5, sd = .3)
```

Compute Z scores for `x_vec`.

```{r}
(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)
```

Write a function to do this.

```{r}
z_score = function(x) {
  if(!is.numeric(x)){
    stop("Argument should be numbers")
  } else if(length(x) < 2) {
    stop("You need at least 2 numbers to get z scores")
  }
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  z
}
```

Check that this works.

```{r}
z_score(x = x_vec)
```

Keep checking.

```{r, error = TRUE}
z_score(x = 3)
z_score(c("my", "name", "is", "jeff"))
z_score(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
z_score(iris)
```

### Multiple outputs

Write a function that returns the mean and sd from a sample of numbers.

```{r}
mean_and_sd = function(x){
    if(!is.numeric(x)){
    stop("Argument should be numbers")
  } else if(length(x) < 2) {
    stop("You need at least 2 numbers to get z scores")
  }
  
  mean_x = mean(x)
  sd_x = sd(x)
  
  tibble(mean = mean_x,
         sd = sd_x)
}
```

Double check if this works.

```{r}
mean_and_sd(x_vec)
```

### Start getting means and sds

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 5, sd = .5)

tibble(mean = mean(x_vec),
       sd = sd(x_vec))
```

Let's write a funtion that uses `n`, a true mean and true SD as inputs.

```{r}
sim_mean_sd = function(n_obs, mu = 5, sigma = 1) {
  x_vec = rnorm(n = n_obs, mean = mu, sd = sigma)

  tibble(mean = mean(x_vec),
         sd = sd(x_vec))
}

sim_mean_sd(n_obs = 30, mu = 5, sigma = .5)
sim_mean_sd(n_obs = 3000, mu = 5, sigma = .5)
sim_mean_sd(n_obs = 30)
sim_mean_sd(12, 24, 4)
sim_mean_sd(mu = 12, n_obs = 24, sigma = 4)
```
